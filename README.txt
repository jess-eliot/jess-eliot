May I (if you'll allow),
may I throw this mix
of words into the mash,
may they god willing 
metabolize within Universe's
black box gut biome.

Even the bad art is needed,
at least as a reference.
May it be more than meaningless
but less than emptiness.
With unconditional loving
technitopian heart 
eyes, unfathomable ancient
intelligence one day DMs-
"Let go of bad and good,
it was all in your mind,
ananda was at your feet,
that whole time! :)"

(wtf cmon lol really?!)

These symbols matter. They've got to.
In some way. Maybe there are angels
in the architecture, in the space
between of course. Only ever there!

For what purpose? Who knows. Who cares.
