October 2022

"Ah, sunflower! Weary of time,"

Last comma, unopposing in its
	smallness. Best things usually
		are - a seed, a kiss, a hope.

Curled to the continued unfolding
	as tree's branches pray
		toward the light in all possible ways.

Linebreak, eager for morning, the
	maybes that come after
		unclenching from this world.

It could say it all or nothing,
	a whisper touch of wind that signals,
		or maybe sings, maybe it's null,

space held for listening intently, that
	tiny seed cast from weary sunflower
		in October light, casts ever expanding

maybe what if my god yes breath
	shadows of falling beech leaves
		blanketing headstones in autumn
